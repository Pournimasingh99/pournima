	<p style="font-size:1.3rem;"><h1> <b>School discipline</b></h1> <br>is the actions taken by a teacher or the school organization towards a student (or group of students) when the student's<br> behavior disrupts the ongoing educational activity or breaks a rule created by the teacher or the school system.<br> Discipline can guide the children's behaviour or set limits to help them learn to take care of themselves,<br> other people and the world around them.[1]
 School systems set rules, and if students break these rules they are subject to discipline.<br> These rules may, for example, define the expected standards of clothing, timekeeping, social conduct, and work ethic.<br> The term "discipline" is applied to the punishment that is the consequence of breaking the rules.<br> The aim of discipline is to set limits restricting certain behaviors or attitudes that are seen as harmful or against school policies, educational norms, school traditions, etc.<br>[1] The focus of discipline is shifting and alternative approaches are emerging due to notably high dropout rates and disproportionate punishment upon minority students</p>
